# MedFlow

After working in a hospital (ER and ICU) for over 20 years I feel that there is a need for a portable med list.  While most hospitals do have medical records that can be accessed from that specific hospital - there will be times when a person is traveling or not at the home hospital.  This app will have a current list of medications and medical history as well as the current demographics and a next of kin available to the health care providers at the facility. 

This app is going to be designed for phone/portable device and eventually added as a wearable.
Geolocation is added so that should there  be a golden or amber alert the location of the patient/wearer of the device
can be tracked to a general location and hopefully a specific location.

there will be a webpage where the information about the patient can be entered and an account can be set up on the user's phone so that information can be easily accessed.
